## Spatial Implicit Neural Representations for Global-Scale Species Mapping - ICML 2023

This code enables the recreation of the results from our ICML 2023 paper [Spatial Implicit Neural Representations for Global-Scale Species Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02564). 

## üåç Overview 
Estimating the geographical range of a species from sparse observations is a challenging and important geospatial prediction problem. Given a set of locations where a species has been observed, the goal is to build a model to predict whether the species is present or absent at any location. In this work, we use Spatial Implicit Neural Representations (SINRs) to jointly estimate the geographical range of thousands of species simultaneously. SINRs scale gracefully, making better predictions as we increase the number of training species and the amount of training data per species. We introduce four new range estimation and spatial representation learning benchmarks, and we use them to demonstrate that noisy and biased crowdsourced data can be combined with implicit neural representations to approximate expert-developed range maps for many species.

# Getting Started

## :hatched_chick: Installation for local development
1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:UMassCDS/ds4cg2024-inaturalist.git`

2. Create .env and .docker.env at the project root. Copy the contents that were given to you on **slack** into these files.

3. Navigate to cloned project's root, run `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update --remote --merge`

4. You are all set for setting up the code.

Note: We need .env for local development, and .docker.env for docker containers. The difference between them is database url, which is caused by how docker manages networks.

Note: to update submodules with latest changes, run `git submodule update --remote --merge`

Note: `src/backend/sinr` is a submodule from `UMassCDS/inatrualist-sinr`, if you need to work on `sinr` code, follow development practices for that repository, this includes making a dedicated development branch, making PRs.

Note: If you need to switch to a particular `UMassCDS/inaturalist-sinr` branch and run the prototype, navigate to `src/backend/sinr`, use `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch to a branch. Now the submodule will be at a different branch.

####  Downloading the pretrained models
If you want to run the app locally for development purposes, download the pretrained models from [here](https://data.caltech.edu/records/dk5g7-rhq64/files/pretrained_models.zip?download=1), unzip them, and place them in a folder located at  
`/src/backend/sinr/pretrained_models`.  
If you only run the app in Docker, there's no need to download the models; Docker will handle this for you inside the image.

# Installing the app

1. We recommend using an isolated Python environment to avoid dependency issues. Install the Anaconda Python 3.9 distribution for your operating system from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download). 

2. Create a new environment and activate it:
```bash
 conda create -y --name inatator python==3.9
 conda activate inatator
```

3. After activating the environment, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r src/backend/requirements.txt && pip install -r src/backend/requirements-dev.txt
```

Note: If you get errors for psycopg2-binary, installing postgres can solve it `brew install postgresql`, repeat step 3 after installing postgres.

4. install js libraries needed for react
```bash
npm i --prefix src/frontend/
```

# :penguin: Running the iNatAtor Application

## Run **database** in first terminal:
1. Navigate to project root
2. Launch **postgres container**:
```bash
docker compose up --build db
```

## Run **backend** in second terminal:
1. Navigate to the main `ds4cg2024-inaturalist` directory if you are not already there:
2. Activate environment:
```bash
  conda activate inatator
```
3. Launch the **backend**:
```bash
  uvicorn src.backend.app.main:app --reload --env-file .env
```
## Run **frontend** in third terminal:
1. Navigate to the main `ds4cg2024-inaturalist` directory if you are not already there:
2. Launch the **frontend**:
```bash
  npm start --prefix src/frontend/
```

In your web browser, open the link [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)


# Running applications with Docker
1. Install Docker if you haven't already
2. Open Docker Desktop, you cannot run containers or build images, if docker engine is not running
2. Now in terminal, navigate to project root
3. Run `docker compose up --build`, for the first build it may take a while, after build the application will be ran, you can access the application through the `localhost:3000`.
5. You can stop containers with ctrl+c or using the Docker app

Common Docker commands:
- If you want to start the application again, run `docker compose up`
- If you want to just build images, run `docker compose build`
- If you want to build and run containers, run `docker compose up --build`
- If you want to build only one service, run `docker compose build <service-name>`, for example `docker compose build backend`

Note: you don't have to initialize submodule to run docker, dockerfile will set up the submodules for you while building the image.


## Working with database

Sometimes you want to run the application without containers, allowing you to develop things quickly. The **Running the iNatAtor Application** section explains how to run the application locally.

You can verify connections are working by going to `localhost:8000/health` and `localhost:8000/echo_env`. Note that these paths are included right now to assist with rapid development, will be removed for production.

Note: The codebase is getting bigger, therefore add database related code in `src/backend/app/db`, then make proper API routes in main, if it gets too big, we can resort to using API routers from fastapi.

Note: There are two environment files (.env and .docker.env) because the database url for local development and docker environments are separate.

Make sure you always update your local branch to the latest.


# Code Standards
1. Use Docstrings, for some functions just a one-liner is fine, but for more complicated functions include multi-line documentation that explains the function simply, has information about arguments, and has details about the output.
2. Module Docstrings, include a short description of module and functions inside the module.
3. Use a formatter if possible. We have included [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting in the developer dependencies in `requirements-dev.txt`.

## üìú Disclaimer
Extreme care should be taken before making any decisions based on the outputs of models presented here. Our goal in this work is to demonstrate the promise of large-scale representation learning for species range estimation, not to provide definitive range maps. Our models are trained on biased data and have not been calibrated or validated beyond the experiments illustrated in the paper.
